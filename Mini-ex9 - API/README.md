### Which API have you chosen?
Giphy

### The process
I worked together with Rasmus on this mini ex. I was not really sure what I wanted to do, but Rasmus suggested that we could use the giphy API and in some way display the gifs on a old television. We used Daniel Shiffmans videos about GIPHY and input as reference. If you just import the giphy API you will get a lot of gifs at the same time, so we had to figure out a way in which the gifs would be shown one at a time. To do this we used the function removeElements. We also decided that we wanted the user to be able to go to the next gif in the array. For this purpose we incorporated HTML elements and programmed the "next" button to display the next gif. 

### The aesthetics of (big) data
There is a certain aesthetic duality in big data: Big data is staging experiences that switches between facts and perception. In order to understand the how users get manipulated (and I don't necessarily mean this in a bad way) I think it is important to be able to seperate the perception from the facts, and to understand what is behind the perception ("the cloud" for example).
