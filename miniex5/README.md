#### Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials?
I wanted to make a poem generator using the lyrics from a song called "Cats in heat" (https://apesofthestate.bandcamp.com/track/cats-in-heat). I like the song because it is weird, and by placing the words in random order in a "poem format" I feel like I made it even weirder. Some of the words appear very often (for example the word "Please") because it appears in the "chorus". I could have just deleted the frecuently used words in the txt file but I liked it this way. RiTa and I never became friends but I hope that we can try again when I have more time and when I am not sick.

#### How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text?
I'm not sure how to answer this question. I feel like the "Cats in heat" lyrics and the poem generator presents two different kinds of "textual characters". The lyrics are coherent and has a plot, while the poems are random and the sentences rarely makes sense. In this way the generator presents the words as "equal" (as in they all have the same value) because they don't really have any relationships to each other when in a random order.
