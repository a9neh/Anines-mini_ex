Now the cats in heat, now the cats in heat
We forgot to turn the AC on
We went to bed and we woke up hot
Please forgive me lord for the things I've done
Please forgive me for the things I've left undone

Now the cats in heat and so are we
I didn't follow cat instructions
And now my cat wants to go and fuck things
Please forgive me lord for the things I did
Please forgive me for the things I've left unsaid

Now the cats in heat
Please forgive me lord for the things I've done
Please forgive me for the wrongs I did
Please forgive me for the words I said
And I'll forgive myself for fucking up again
