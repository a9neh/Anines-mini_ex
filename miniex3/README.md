### My throbber design
#### Empire State of Banana
My throbber design is inspired by painting I made about a year ago (https://www.instagram.com/p/_eyhN-Ku7o/?taken-by=l0sh).

I used the throbber from Winnie's slides and changed it a bit in order for the throbber  to look how I wanted it to. Then I tried to import the Banana-GIF file and... That was a STRUGGLE. So I got some help from a guy in my dorm. The next day I met with my study group because we have to prepare a presentation on sound and video. Ann (our instructor) donated a sound file so that I could try it out myself. Now my throbber has background music. 

### How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?
When I designed my throbber I thought about what I want to look at while my computer is buffering. The answer is not a throbber. Throbbers are annoying because they do not tell you how long you have to wait. A progress bar would be ideal, because it indicates how far it is in the process.  I thought about the throbbers I have seen, and whether or not to change the look of it completely. I reflected on the traditional spinning throbber and the context I usually see it in. In this way I reflected on how I percieve throbbers and waiting on data to load while designing one myself.
