#### My coding process
I started out drawing a sketch of the plasticbag on a post-it. I drew it in a simplified way so i knew that i would be able to draw it with simple shapes in p5.js. In p5.js I started out by deciding the background colour. After that I startet coding the 3 white rectangles that represents the bag and the handles. It was tricky for me to find out what the arguments represented so that the rectangles would be the right size and in the right place. When the bag was in the right place it was easier for me to decide the arguments for the text ("TAHNK YOU") because I could compare it to the arguments of the bag. At last i adjusted the stroke of the text and removed the stroke in the rectangles.
#### What constitutes a program?
A program is a visualization made with code. The program is often interactive so that whn you click something, something will happen. (input and output)
#### Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?)
Errors can happen in a lot of ways. In my illustrated example (the plastic bag), the hypothetical manufactor of the bag made a spelling error, simply by hitting the keys in a wrong order. Another kind of error is typically detected when the outcome of your action is something different than they expected it to be. Maybe the creator would consider the unexpected outcome to be wrong, but it could also be quite pleasing, making the creator reconsider the original plan.
