The title of my piece is "House of Secrets".

Let me explain what I actually wanted it to do:
-When you slide the door open, there was supposed to be a smirk-face emoji behind it. This worked perfectly in my editor but the browser was just not having it. Very frustrating, I was so proud.
-When you type something in the window, the "submit" button is supposed to publish it on the big cloud. Sadly I couldn't make this work

### What are the advantages in using objects and what might be the limitations? What's your experience in using objects?
The advantages in using the HTML5 objects is that you can play with a well known aesthetic and use it in ways people havent seen before. In this way you can experiment with peoples expactations and test the limits of this internet aesthetic. If I was to only use HTML5 objects I might feel very limited, which is why I cheated. In my piece I used a lot of basic shapes to create a house and then I used the HTML5 objects to make it interactive (if it worked, that is).
