## Title
Special Snowflake
Every time you press a key, a new and slightly different snowflake is made

## What are the rules that you have employed in your program?
I have 3 if-statements in my program. The first one makes sure that the "trees" stop looping when the snowflake is complete. The second and third one make the "branches" appear different every time you press a key, because it sometimes branches once instead of twice

## By using some of the concepts from the article - Generative Art Theory, can you discuss how is your program expressed the notion of generativity? (such as authorship/nonhuman creation/autonomous system/Complexity/Emergent behaviour etc)
In Generative Art Theory, Philip Galanter talks about the the problem of uniqueness: does it diminish the value of the art when unique objects can be mass-produced? I find this problem very interesting, because as Galanter says: rather than offering an endless supply of copies, generative art provides an endless supply of original and unique artifacts. The artifacts are unique - just like snowflakes - but mass-produced, and therefore it is difficult to determine the value of them.
