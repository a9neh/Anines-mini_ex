#### A Short description of your work and tell us how your work demonstrats the notion of "feedback" or "cybernetics"
My work is a "bouncing ball". The "ball" is a rotating donut GIF i found online. When the donut hits the walls, the background changes color depending on which wall the donut hits. In this way the program communicates with itself, because the donut "dictates" what colour the background changes to. You can in this way percieve the change of colour as feedback.
