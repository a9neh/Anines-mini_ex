#### What is your selected coding challenge?
Random walker

#### What function/syntax have you added?
I loaded an image I found on the internet

#### What is the difficulty of this week mini exercise?
The difficulty of this challenge for me was to figure out how to draw a flowchart of the challenge. I am sure there's a million ways to draw a flowchart on this piece of code, and i still feel like I did it wrong, since there is no end-point, it just keeps looping. I didn't use a lot of "technical" words in my flowchart, because I wanted it to be understood by people who hasn't coded before.

#### How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow chart?
By drawing a flowchart, you get a different understanding of your program. You "cut it open" and try to see exactly how it works, and in what order the different functions work. It is also a good tool to help explain your program to non-technical people, because it allows you to exchange the technical words and algorithms with words most people understand.
